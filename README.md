# InterviewHub
This application is designed to speed up the selective process by automating hard/soft skill tests and giving empowering feedbacks that help recruitment processes make the best decision. 

The hub can be helpful at smaller studios, but the value of this design becomes apparent specially at big companies selectives processes, where recruitment teams often need to face hundreds of applications with tight schedules. 
At Interview Hub, candidates are redirected to skill tests specific to their application/background and are able to complete this exam step at time they see fit.
There are some good examples of this automated interview process, such as:  peopleHum, Workable, Dripify and Linkedin Recruiter.
